## My process

### Built with

- Semantic & Non-semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of flex and two-column layouts.

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on flex/grid and refactoring, in future projects.

- [stackoverflow: Background Image Not Working](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15162148/100-width-height-background-image-not-working) - I'd accidentally set the width as max-width: 100vw instead of width: 100%.
